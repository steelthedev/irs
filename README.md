# Industrial Record System

Welcome to the Industrial Record System! This application serves as an inventory management system built using Go and Gin framework. It allows you to create users, administrators, products, perform CRUD operations on products, manage product quantities, and authenticate users via JWT.

## Work in Progress

This version of the Industrial Record System is a work in progress. Here are some features and improvements planned for the next version:

1. **User Roles**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish between regular users and administrators. This will allow for finer-grained control over system permissions.

2. **Improved Authentication**: Enhance authentication mechanisms by implementing features such as password hashing and session management to improve security.

3. **Enhanced Product Management**: Introduce advanced product management functionalities such as categorization, search, and filtering capabilities to make it easier to manage a large number of products.

4. **User Interface Refinement**: Update the user interface to improve usability and enhance the overall user experience.

5. **API Documentation**: Generate comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman to facilitate easier integration and development for external users or developers.
